/**
 * Display a Note
 * https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/display-a-note.html
 *
 * We are doing a couple of things here.
 * 1. We are using the useEffect Hook to load the note when our component first loads. We then save it to the state.
 *    We get the id of our note from the URL using the props automatically passed to us by React-Router in props.match.params.id.
 *    The keyword id is a part of the pattern matching in our route (/notes/:id).
 * 2. If there is an attachment, we use the key to get a secure link to the file we uploaded to S3. We then store this
 *    in the new note object as note.attachmentURL.
 * 3. The reason why we have the note object in the state along with the content and the attachmentURL is because we
 *    will be using this later when the user edits the note.
 *
 * @param props
 * @returns {*}
 * @constructor

     * We are doing a few things here:
     * 1. We render our form only when the note state variable is set.
     * 2. Inside the form we conditionally render the part where we display the attachment by using note.attachment.
     * 3. We format the attachment URL using formatFilename by stripping the timestamp we had added to the filename while uploading it.
     * 4. We also added a delete button to allow users to delete the note. And just like the submit button it too needs a flag that signals that the call is in progress. We call it isDeleting.
     * 5. We handle attachments with a file input exactly like we did in the NewNote component.
     * 6. Our delete button also confirms with the user if they want to delete the note using the browserâ€™s confirm dialog.
